# Simulator

## 0. Objective
Setup and use the simulation environment. Control a virtual robot and use the live plotting tool.

## 1. Simulator & Plotter
### Simulator
The simulator was built by using the PyGame, it simulates a robot in the center and a map skeleton around it, which is the same map as we did in Lab 9.

In order to control the simulator and make the robot move, we can use the four arrow keys on the keyboard. Up/Down controls the linear velocity, and Left/Right controls the angular velocity. To freeze the robot, simply press the space bar. Press down the 'h' key will show a keyboard control legend on the left top.

### Plotter
To start the simulator and the plotter, execute the following command, then it shows four buttons, click on them and the corresponding window will show up.

Or use the start/stop/reset command blocks.
