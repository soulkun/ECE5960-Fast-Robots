# Localization on the real robot

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to perform localization, using only the update step of the Bayes filter on the actual robot.

### Test Localization in Simulation
Green: Ground Truth

Blue: Belief

Red: Odometry

As the screenshot shows below, the belief is almost same as the ground truth, therefore the bayes filter works very well.
